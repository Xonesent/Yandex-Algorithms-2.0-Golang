It's hard to evaluate my solutions, because most of the unsolved problems fail initial tests. I guess it is because I misunderstood the condition and one of the basic edge cases does not pass. Still haven't figured out what's wrong, as everything works fine in my own tests. 

However, all the topics remained the same as in the previous part. Therefore, the main goal was to memorize the material and be sure that in future tasks I will be able to quickly determine which tool/ structure to use to solve them.

Moreover, the whole Division B took no more than a week and a half of my time in parallel with other stuff, such as university projects and so on. I suspect the most interesting content is in the A division, but I don't think I'm close to competitive programming, I'd need to learn the basics first
